// This file is used to configure the JavaScript project settings for the frontend of the PKBS web application.
// It specifies the base URL for module resolution, allowing for cleaner import statements throughout the project.
// The "baseUrl" is set to "src", which means that all module imports will be resolved relative to the "src" directory.
// This setup helps in organizing the codebase and avoiding long relative paths in import statements.
// For example, instead of importing a module with a long relative path like `../../../components/MyComponent`, you can simply use `components/MyComponent`.
// This configuration is particularly useful in larger projects where maintaining clean and readable import paths is essential for code maintainability and clarity
